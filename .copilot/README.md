# Copilot Workspace Configuration

This directory contains configuration files that help GitHub Copilot understand and work more effectively with the Accurack Software Frontend project.

## Files in this directory:

### `instructions.md`

Contains comprehensive instructions for GitHub Copilot, including:

- Project overview and architecture
- Coding standards and conventions
- Development guidelines
- Common patterns and examples
- Questions to ask before implementation

## How it works:

When you use GitHub Copilot in this workspace, it will:

1. **Analyze your prompts** against the project context
2. **Create implementation plans** based on the established patterns
3. **Ask for confirmation** before making significant changes
4. **Follow the coding standards** defined in the instructions
5. **Maintain consistency** with the existing codebase

## Benefits:

- **Consistent Code**: All Copilot suggestions follow project conventions
- **Better Context**: Copilot understands the project's architecture and patterns
- **Guided Development**: Copilot asks relevant questions before implementing features
- **Quality Assurance**: Suggestions align with project standards and best practices

## Usage:

Simply use GitHub Copilot as normal in your IDE. The instructions will be automatically applied to provide context-aware suggestions and guidance.

For complex feature requests, Copilot will:

1. Analyze the existing codebase
2. Create an implementation plan
3. Ask for your approval
4. Proceed with implementation following the established patterns
